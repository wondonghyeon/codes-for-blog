# Satellite Images

This folder includes code for satellite image analysis.

## Google Earth Engine

If you are running a script that ues [Google Earth Engine](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine) API, please follow [the instructions](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/python_install#expandable-2) by Google to get the [private key](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/service_account#use-a-service-account-with-a-private-key). If you are not familiar with Google Cloud, like me, it'll take forever. Hope you figure out. When you get the private key as a json file, please save it as `codes-for-blog/satellite/.private-key`. It might not be the best practice to store a key with the code... but I'll just do it. Please don't share this file with anyone though.
